# Memory Game

The objective of the game is to match all of the pairs of cards. Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its image. If you find a matching pair, they will stay face up. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over, and you can try again.

The game features three different difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty level has a different number of cards and a different theme.
